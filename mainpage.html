<h1>Teen Titans Go!</h1>
<p><b>Teen Titans Go!</b> is one of most popular show in the United States. It is an Comedic Animated TV 
    series that shows about five youn superheroes who are not only a team but and roomates, but also good
    friends. Robin, Raven, Starfire, BeastBoy and Cyborg are the five main characters of this show in 
    which Robin is the leader of the team who is always serious whereas the rest of the members are 
    quirky. Each of them have their own uinque powers and personalities. This show focus on exploring 
    their everday adventures instead of only on serious crime or fighting like handling silly problems, 
    competing with each other, trying to do chores etc. Aaron Horvath and Michael Jelenic are the 
    creators of the show "<b>Teen Titans Go!</b>". In 2013, <b>Teen Titans Go!</b> started airing on 
    Cartoon Network and it became popular quickly for its colorful, humor, and exaggerated animation. 
    There are 8 seasons with 23 episodes which makes the total episodes 391 spread across many seasons. 
    For now, season 8 is still airing and season 9 is going to release very soon. It entertaining for 
    both kids and adults because on superhero stories, it has fun twist with adventures and jokes. You 
    can watch <b>Teen Titans Go!</b> on Cartoon Network, HBO Max, Hulu and Youtube TV which is easy to 
    enjoy this lighthearted take on superhero life. This is the reason why I love this show as it is 
    filled with humor which makes everyone laugh and smile. This show makes me forget all the stress that
    I have.
